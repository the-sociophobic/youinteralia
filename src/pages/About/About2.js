    What hopes are linked to the conversation as such? Is it a way to get to know someone (better), or is it rather a chance to get a glimpse of an unfamiliar context and an atmosphere, a different life another is writing from and ultimately a way to relate to each other in and through writing?<br />
    <br />
    With all this in mind we initiated what we had though would become a series of written exchanges between artists participating in «You, inter alia».<br />
    A correspondence, awkwardly called ‘newsletters’ proposed a writing experiment around a broad topic «What do you think about when you walk around?» with a new sub-theme to be suggested each week or so.<br />
    <br />
    In the end, the соrrespondance turned out to be a conversation rather, which as such does not necessarily imply back and forth exchange of messages and consists of pauses, silences, misfires and ultimately is infinite. Yet, what is infinite must be finished within a set timeframe and the only way for it to be sustained is to allow it to haunt us as a kind of a fantasy of the conversation.<br />
    <br />
    We publish conversation in its finite infinity and we hope (we fantasise) that it will continue.
