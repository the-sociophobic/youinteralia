        I have become very anxious recently. They say that having some kind of a blueprint or a recipe for the future—an instruction to follow—usually helps to overcome fears or feelings of uncertainty, just like making lists supposedly does. This makes me think of one performance artist who was obsessed with making lists. Probably, for her that was a choreographic practice of some sort. What will/should/could/ this become for me, or for you?
        <br />
        <br />
        I have been thinking if walking is a way of making a list as well, a way of translating steps into future exhaustion or distraction from doubts and unease.

        My son Senya is turning 2 years old next week. Each day, regardless of weather, moods or desires I’m getting the two of us dressed for a slow walk around the neighborhood. While he is sleeping or looking around learning to make sense of the world, I think of what to cook for him/us for dinner. It’s getting more and more difficult with this. I’ve tried a lot of recipes. I even began to write down and save some, because I couldn’t remember all of them anymore (this reminds me of how my mum was collecting recipes in her big notebook—a book full of notes and dates, which resembled a diary). In time I got my favorites: the ones that were quick and easy to make. For example, banana pancakes: press and mash 1 banana, addan egg, a spoonful of sour cream, a pinch of soda or baking powder, pinch of salt, any flour (I prefer whole grain), mix everything until thick dough and bake over low heat. This is a very quick recipe (I spend around 15 minutes) and Senya loves these pancakes a lot.
        <br />
        <br />
        Funny, how thinking about cooking helps you to get past the day and brings more balance and structure to your present and to the future. Our grandmothers certainly knew something about that. A recipe for the future. What’s yours?

        It was Friday, December 18, 2020. I was cycling in the rain and listening to the audiobook at the same time. It was «History» of Herodotus, but I was reading «Man without properties» by Meisel the day before. And my thoughts were somewhere between the Lydians, Medes, Persians and Austria at the beginning of the 20th century. I went to a meeting in one gallery and it’s surprising that there we started talking about Christmas, and one of the interlocutors said that her husband is Persian and they would not celebrate Christmas, but “Yelda”, that is, the longest night (Zaroastristic holiday). They will eat melons, juicy fruits and other traditional food for the holly day. I was amazed at the softness of the shape of her hand holding the cup, and the smell of her hair with some kind of incense, while she spoke. I thought about the Turks and their bright beauty. We spoke Russian, by the way. In the «man without properties» I was just at the place of the description of the beauty-cousin of the protagonist, whom he calls «the beauty-hydra», and writes about some nodules on the neck covered with thin delicate skin (I am attracted by this detail probably because I did not understand in any way what it means and how it looks).
        <br />
        <br />
        Immediately after the meeting, I received a letter, and it brought my mood cheerful. I thought about the dishes and the fact that they really make our life more wonderful: the day before yesterday I was preparing «herring under a fur coat». For a long time, scratching my fingers on the grater, and pulling out the remnants of mayonnaise from an uncomfortable jar with my finger, then washing the table, hands and laying out the salad in plastic ice cream cans. Yes - it was an amazingly lively and real experience. The salad, despite such sloppy cooking, was very tasty. And yes, I’ve been dreaming of making sauerkraut for a month now, but the lack of cans and some aesthetic side of storage stops me …

        Hi there!<br />
        <br />
        Sorry it took me so long to start this correspondence. It feels pretty unnatural to address a group of people most of whom I don’t know at all and who know nothing about me. I had a big temptation to write a letter to Roman Osminkin who is my old friend and whose posts I follow from time to time on Facebook but rarely find time to respond.<br />
        <br />
        Maybe to overcome this feeling of unease I need to give you some information about myself and my current situation and also explain my attitude to this project.<br />
        <br />
        I was born and have lived most of my life in Saint-Petersburg, have worked as an artist in this city. One year and nine months ago I gave birth. My son was diagnosed with Down syndrome and a heart problem. Russian cardiologists were insisting on the need of operation on the<br />
        open heart, so I freaked out and decided to use my Jewish roots in order to hear another opinion and immigrated to Israel with my son. I thought that we would be able to travel back and forth every few months but it was one week before the first lockdown started here. So all of a sudden the situation became dreadfully similar to 1970-ies when there was the Iron curtain and the borders were impenetratable. I have to admit, though, that by now I am not very nostalgic of Saint-Petersburg itself and its unbearably long winters. I am totally enchanted by the beautiful and dramatic Jaffa, the city where we settled, the town which is a specter of it’s own with all streets names changed, with all the houses ruined or stolen, with so many layers of history… Mostly I walk in Saint-Petersburg in my dreams. Often I have a dream that I’m going home, to my appartment in Saint-Petersburg but something is going wrong with the space or maybe with me. Either I can’t find the way from metro to my place, or I enter the wrong front door or wrong floor or wrong appartment. Here the sun makes all the colours so bright. It gives a sense of intense presence and extra materiality to all the objects that it lights upon, so that my memories of my grey hometown become more and more dreamlike. The most solid record that I have of the city is my archive of notes and sent and unsent letters of last few years that I am trying to organise from time to time. So my plan is to work with one of those texts in the course of this project.<br />
        <br />
        Best regards,<br />

        Olya Jitlina, thank you very much for such an honest letter, you are a big heart.<br />
        <br />
        Dear colleagues, hello, I don’t know any of you, except for Olya Jitlina and Alena Tereshko. But it’s not that important now. It does not matter in this case, since one of the exposed conditions of our relationship today is the situation of weak communities on the other side of the family. Platform capitalism has won, but completely unintended, weak, translocal, horizontal, affective, emotional, aesthetic, situational, short-term and other communities and connections arise within it. This is the aleatory materialism of coincidences, about which Althusser wrote, relying on Lenin. These are not fanclubs or sects, but parainstitutions that can corrode capitalist hierarchies and recode the corporate mode of production. But this does not happen by itself. We are all vulnerable and precarious in different ways in different parts of the world. And it is important to understand and be aware of your privileges on the one hand and worries and fears on the other. There are no ready-made recipes for the future, but there are specific connections of our thinking bodies, biosocial substances with a specific situation in time and space. The pandemic has laid bare our living and working conditions. Our background behind our back during a zoom conference is part of the common space, today it is political and aesthetic. Therefore, the only thing I can offer is to be open, not to close, not to withdraw into oneself in solipsism, not to close in the illusion of the past, to seek a dialogue with others. We are not alone, we are united by the common matter of life, today this has become especially evident. Excuse my English, I’m writing with a google translate assistant, this is another corporation invention that helps us find common ground)).<br />

        Hello,<br />
        <br />
        I have often thought of you without ever finding the time to sit down to write to you. You compose in my mind a line of floating letters that I cannot attach to any voice or face (except that of Andrea I know).<br />
        <br />
        I preferred not to search for your faces or your voices on Google but I explore some maps of St. Petersburg and Jaffa. I am in Geneva and from my window I see the roof of the buildings, a tiny piece of Léman Lake and the Jura ridge line that marks the border with France. Shortly before the pandemic began, I returned from Montreal where I was living with my partner and our ten-year-old son. The main reason for our move was that I was going back to school at the University of Quebec in Montreal. From the first month there, I started dreaming about Geneva and sometimes during the day, walking on a street, riding on my bike, appeared to me images of the city that I had left and which I did not particularly miss. I dreamed a lot of the lake and I even smell the algae that the wind sometimes brings into my apartment when the windows are open in the summer. I also heard the sound of boats waving like bells when there are waves. Geneva was the main city of my dreams at first but then came other cities in which I lived, cities that I often visit because I have family there. In one dream I could walk from Geneva to Buenos Aires. I then took the train to visit my grandmother in a small village south of Barcelona. From there, it seemed easy to go to dinner with my sister who was waiting for us in Brussels. Oddly enough, my cousins in Madrid could not join us because it involved several days of complicated travel. When a dream made me travel from Montreal to Buenos Aires, there were always stops in Europe according to a wacky geography that I could not correct. When I returned to Switzerland, I began to dream naturally of Canada. I sometimes spent a whole night driving my car on a road in New Brunswik between two forests.<br />
        <br />
        The habit of walking around cities at night was born in Montreal and has intensified since last March. It’s a joyous activity most of the time. I find loved places and sometimes I discover places I didn’t know yet. But I feel that these nocturnal walks are also related to my sorrow. A way to get my sorrow down my feet. Distribute it evenly in the body so that it weighs less.<br />
        <br />
        Fortunately, I don’t dream of zoom discussions, zoom lectures, zoom shows, zomm classes, zoom party, zoom yoga.<br />
        For every invisible link, for every virtual experience, I decided to perform a very concrete act, a gesture in material world. Doing so, I hope to keep my life in balance, and not get lost.<br />
        <br />
        Then, to «balance» this letter, I want to cook a herring under a fur coat. Alena, would you give me your recipe?<br />
        <br />

        Hello,<br />
        and thank you, that was a special reading—such a diversity of conditions and surroundings.<br />
        <br />
        I realized that in the past we had brief talks with Olga—I think it was coffin boat performance in Gorky Culture Park in Moscow and Roman—during his poetry reading at MediaArtLab, it was quite a long time ago and I don`t remember exactly the year so I hope these are not phantom memories.<br />
        <br />
        In the beginning I would like to mention this feeling (it is more of a feeling than a thought) that during the walk in the forest silence is thinking by me, not vice versa. And it is not always about being calm and transparent. It also has something to with pan as a metaphor of wilderness spirit which is almost completely lost when I`m getting back to the city and today`s field of restless communication which often seems to be more like monotonous technology and data worshipping than the communication itself. I feel that during the long walking by foot some kind of movement within my mind and my body is born. The kind of movement which becomes paralyzed when I`m back to daily life within the huge city of Moscow, there is kind of data smog, thick black clouds of data smog which are hanging over multi-floor panel houses. So this movement freezes but it is not gone completely, it could be compared to water, I could think of it as ice that hides in its crystalline structure. Now it is winter and these inner crystalline structures relate to outer space, snow is a kind of damper, an agent of silence which creates a special place to play with these movements being born. For that period we are not walking on the ground, and even such fun activities as snowballs throwing or sliding down the hill in different ways are more fluent. Gliding and sliding not just walking. So silence becomes a space where the mind is stretching its lines and patterns like a skier.<br />
        <br />
        There is a pendulum-like swing in my life for recent years when I live both in the city of Moscow and in a village house. I got a feeling of loss when I walk through Moscow streets now—for almost five years I was renting a small room in the center of the city being almost enchanted by the sudden existence of quite avenues near unlike its «noisy» social spaces. A year ago I made a meditative videowork called «Lanes» to explore this feeling of space. Now I often<br />
        feel like a dropout from it—for the last year the main sound in the city was alarm siren and robotic voice coming out of police cars and when going by public transport there are sudden outbursts of lo-fi speeches and noises from mobile phones. And this recorded speech is heard more often than the speech itself. Sometimes there are outbursts of scenes that seem more alive, which feel more alive—do they have connection with my own state of mind I ask myself? Then I go with my father or by myself to that village house and what strikes me here mostly is moving silence of the forest—all the sound becomes distant and wide—planes and trains passing by—birds chanting suddenly. This is especially felt at winter—this winter the snow is all around—now that I`m writing this and this snow is oddly similar to the blank space of the screen where this letter is written. This whiteness of space torn by trees immersed in a deep dream. And I remember this audio visual image from Holderlin`s poem — «a bell silenced by a snowflake».The city is a tolling bell sounding behind all these electronic sirens and the neverending drone of its machinery, and this village like a snowflake with crystallizing patterns on windows. I look at them and they remind me of those thoughts and movements I`ve come across on my long walking-sliding-gliding trip through this winter.<br />

        Hi there,<br />
        As Carla said, she’s the only one to knows me and same to me. Like everyone, this blind date messages are for me in the same time strange but I’m a gamer and I find the whole process playful.<br />
        <br />
        I’m writing so late because last month was a big transition in my life. I run an art space alone for 3 years and my period just ended in December, I had to manage transition with newcomers directors and also change all the set-up of my house. My flat hosted every exhibition artist in residency and for last 3 years I didn’t feel it as my house and in the same time it was for the people coming. The art space is in the small town Bienne, near capital Bern, a small city where a lot of «underdogs» come to live, rent are very cheaper than other Swiss city and by train you can basically rise all others in 1h-1h30. So there is a scene of musicians, some anarchist, drugs addicts and others kind of bohemian, and of cours « normal » people. I came to live here to manage the art space and took the flat to welcome artist. I was back from one year travel around east Europe, almost manage to reach st-petersbourg, and one year living half in my van, half here and there in Switzerland to make exhibitions. I was finacially broke and did one season as chef in a small restaurant in a lake-lido (where people can bath) meanwhile I did all program and funding for the following year as artist-curator. With the new flat and so, I wasn’t less broke than before and I basically pass all my first year as director, waiting for exhibitions cash backs to eat and for luck, maybe good Karma, by surprise every month I had a surprise gig to just end the month.<br />
        <br />
        So my house, was a mess, with first resident I had no table and chairs in the kitchen and first two days we made pic-nics on the floor, fortunately they had a car and I use part of art space budget to buy a table and chairs, for the art residency purpose. I took six months to have all facilities for artist, and if the first were kind of camping-friendly, others start to say that I wasn’t really a good curator and did care enough to artist. The art space isn’t a white cube, so with that some artist also accepted the invitation for having an exhibition and than weren’t enthusiast about the reality of the space, small amount of money and a «on progress» residence. I did have salary for that, especially the first year. Than I could make a survival living from the second year, I increase 3 times the annual previous budget of the space and so I could reserve a part for me, paid at the end of the year with what is left.<br />
        <br />
        In the second year I had to deal mostly with status, on one hand people saying that I’m thinking to big for the reality of my space and I should take it more easy with art theory and statements, on the other hands artist were often trying to *deconstruct* my role of a director, like I was one of a big museum. To make it short, I had often the impression to be a punching bull, to who is possible to complain about stuff going on in «real institution», because with small like me there is no consequences for a carrer. The main point was that I was having a professional attitude, with some experimental expectations, but in fact I noticed that most of artist prefer a «friendly attitude» made by prosecco’s and restaurant dinners and leave the art process kind of secondary, because the space isn’t so important… There was no restaurant because I cooked home and as «street-former» chef it was better to Make diners at home with more «sophisticated food» and wine that would cost the same to eat a couple of pizza in town, Swiss restaurant are kind of investment in the social life.<br />
        <br />
        The third year is the COVID, but thanks to a side project of we radio art I could make activity, actually I did work more than usual, but also start to get paid a bit because I could ask others supports. In small «no-covid» windows in calendar I could make few residency and all exhibitions planned, ending with a radio exhibition made by 6 residencies between November- December.<br />
        I’m saying that, but please don’t misunderstand, isn’t a complain, to say the positive, through all conflicts and fight with artist I convinced that exhibitions made in the space have been all successful to be an original proposition, challenging all artist to explore a side of their practice: formally or work in a rush of two weeks, deal with drug addiction and finishing in time, no having their usual network coming in «no fancy art space in a small town», understand that the curator don’t have to be seductivly friendly to be interested in the work and push in challenges and so on….<br />
        I’m saying with with humour: all of this didn’t makes me a good reputation around. I have been happy to make all these experiences in the last three years and would take me much more text to write you what make me through it and my reasons.<br />
        <br />
        Shit, I’m already the one that wrote more? I had « taking space » issue, sorry, I’m not doing it by purpose, I got lost in the story telling, I had « synthetic » issues too… Do you know synthesis is Carthesian (by philosophers Descarte) and the opposite is «Proliferation» (which is a synonyme of Ryzhome, taken later by Deleuze).<br />
        <br />
        So in general I’m into proliferation.<br />
        <br />
        I would have told you how is going now after the three years, but maybe I can just resuming that I took last month<br />
        To «curate» my living room, and my flat to focus on my projects and thanks to Covid Lockdown I really enjoy time alone,<br />
        Feels like the virus did arrive in the right moment for me.<br />
        Yep, I guess that’s all, other wise I’m restarting in some more storytelling, I’m happy to make this work<br />
        Hope to know some of you better<br />
        <br />

        Dear all!<br />
        <br />
        I don’t know any of you, and although I don’t know you, I often thought of you when I was passing through Geneva.<br />
        First of all, I have to say that Geneva is foreign to me, I live in Zurich. I don’t really know the city of Geneva very well, I don’t really have a connection with it. I had been to Geneva a few times to visit a friend, near Pleinpalais, but this was more than 15 years ago. I know that my great-grandfather lived in Geneva with his family, from 1914- 1916, running a lace shop on Rue de Grenus. And then there is my grandfather’s letter to his cousin. Grandfather mentions that he wrote to the Red Cross as some family members had disappeared in France during WW2 and if the Red Cross knew more about them. The Red Cross is also located in Geneva, Avenue de la Paix.<br />
        <br />
        These three places define my route, Plainpalais, Rue de Grenus, Avenue de la Paix (Red Cross). Walking along this route, I tried to be completely open, the spaces of thought that opened up were unexpected and interesting:<br />
        <br />
        The neighbourhood I walk reminds me of the 17th arrondissement I had lived in Paris, near the Boulevard Périphérique, almost out in St Denis. I hurry through the streets, they are narrow, my suitcase makes: clack, clack - because of the grooves, and there is dog shit, lots of trampled dog shit, just like in Paris. In Paris you always have to look at the ground to avoid stepping in dog shit. I only remember that now, I never thought about it before. It sometimes takes a push to trigger the memory, it doesn’t just come out of nowhere, something makes the shift happen the spaces of thought.<br />
        <br />
        Warm wishes, Françoise
